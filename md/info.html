<h2 id="credit">Credit</h2>
<p>I couldn't have done this alone.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe I could. But not with the same results.</p>
<p>I would especially like to thank the leafcat team for helping me out quite a bit.</p>
<p>Some people who have helped a lot include:</p>
<ul>
<li>danielpox, for letting me steal his name generation code</li>
<li>nilsding, for heping me test various parts of the site</li>
<li>howl, for raging at me all the time because my PHP is shit</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-">Why?</h2>
<p>The goal of this site was to learn PHP. However, as I've made it, I ended up making it public. So thank you to everyone who uses it.
People using my work is only more motivation to keep doing it, so I thank you dearly for that, whomever reads this</p>
<h2 id="source-code">Source code</h2>
<p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/QuadPiece/QuadFile">GitHub</a></p>
<p>It might not always be up to date, but it will be updated from time to time.</p>
