<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h1>
<h3 id="what-happened-to-the-random-section-">What happened to the random section?</h3>
<p>The random section required a lot of resources to run due to how terribly it was coded.
If you really need an alternative, I recommend <a href="https://b.thehowl.it">Randeeb by Howl</a></p>
<h3 id="i-don-t-have-videos-in-webm-or-mp4-format-why-don-t-you-accept-other-video-types-">I don't have videos in WebM or MP4 format. Why don't you accept other video types?</h3>
<p>I don't accept other file types as they're not optimized for the internet. (In fact, not all MP4 files are either)
If you want to convert videos to WebM (Recommended format) for uploading, download the newest release of <a href="https://github.com/nixxquality/WebMConverter/releases">4chan's WebM converter</a> and run your file through that.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-look-at-all-my-files-">Do you look at all my files?</h3>
<p>I do not take a detailed look on files. However, I skim across image thumbnails as I am required to due to Norway's laws
(To check for child porn and all that stuff)
I will however never share images found while moderating.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-does-your-server-cost-">How much does your server cost?</h3>
<p>Roughly $10 per month. It's quite an affordable VPS and for now it seems to be enough. In the future I might have to move to a dedicated server though, and that can get quite expensive.</p>
<h3 id="quadfile-is-slow-what-s-going-on-">QuadFile is slow, what's going on?</h3>
<p>It's probably under heavy load. As the server is only a VPS, the network connection is shared.
Due to this I depend on CloudFlare's CDN service to lower the bandwidth load on the server, but at times, it's simply not enough.<br>After a while it'll probably get back on its feet with proper speed.</p>
<h3 id="how-much-storage-does-the-server-have-">How much storage does the server have?</h3>
<p>This is scalable, so the answer is: However much I might need.</p>
<h3 id="what-would-happen-if-quadfile-grew-past-what-you-can-afford-to-maintain-">What would happen if QuadFile grew past what you can afford to maintain?</h3>
<p>There are 3 possible options, that I would even consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding ads to make the service self-sustaining.</li>
<li>Placing the server in Read-only mode so that no new files could be uploaded, but existing files would still be accessible.</li>
<li>QuadFile gets shut down (Pretty unlikely)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than this I might ask for donations when problems start to occur, but for now it's running nicely though.</p>
<h3 id="stats-pl0x-">Stats pl0x?</h3>
<p><strong>As of writing this = November 7th 2014</strong></p>
<p>The server pumps out everything from 50 MB to about 1 GB daily. Typically it ends up at about 250 MB per day though.<br>The server has almost reached 300 files (of which roughly 230 are images)<br>QuadFile gets around 300 to 500 visits a day</p>
